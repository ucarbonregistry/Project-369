# Project-369
Carbon Credit Generation Project by NSL Sugars Ltd. at Koppa, Karnataka.

UCR Monitoring period : First Monitoring period

Period : 10 years, 00 months.

Start date : 01 January 2013

End date : 31 December 2022
____________________
NSL Sugars Limited (NSL), formerly known as SCM Sugars Ltd, is one of the most efficient sugar
companies in south India and a sugar arm of ‘NSL’ group. NSL Group entered the ‘sugar’ business
being related to agro- commercial crop business.

The current project activity included under this UCR document is a combination of two scopes
included under the Koppa Sugar unit of NSL Sugars Ltd. Which is located in Koppa Village,
Maddur Taluka in the district of Mandya in Karnataka state.

The main scopes are:
Scope 1: generation of carbon credits due to an existing 26 MW bagasse-based cogeneration unit at the Koppa sugar mill.
Scope 2: generation of carbon credits due to production and applicability of bioethanol
produced in the Koppa unit which is supplied to OMCs for blending with petrol or
equivalent services.

Both these scopes are well recognized activities under GHG mechanisms due to the reduction of
carbon emissions as compared to their respective baseline scenarios viz. displacement of grid
electricity with the export power produced & supplied from the co-generation unit and displacement
of petrol with a share of blending of bioethanol supplied by NSL.
_____________
The purpose of the project activity is to utilize available mill generated bagasse effectively for
generation of steam and electricity for both in-house consumption and to export surplus electricity
to the power grid. The project meets the captive steam and power requirement of sugar unit, cogeneration (Cogen) plant auxiliaries and power requirement of the facilities. The balance power is
exported to Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL).

As per design specification, the NSL Koppa unit has an existing co-generation unit with installed
capacity of 26 MW, out of which 1.8 MW is for auxiliary consumption, 5.2 MW is captiveconsumption and the rest 19 MW is exported to the grid. The project is operational since June 2004.
The Project is owned by M/s NSL Sugars Ltd. hereby to be called as Project Proponent.
The major equipment of the project activity comprises 110 Tons Per Hour (TPH) capacity steam
generator with the outlet steam parameters of 87 kg/cm2 and 515oC, 26 MW capacity turbine
generator set of Double Extraction cum Condensing (DEC) type and electrical evacuation package
for power export to KPTCL grid. Plant operates for 340 days per annum, which includes 310 days
of crushing season, and balance 30 days during off-season. The plant is designed with all other
auxiliary plant systems like bagasse / biomass handling system with storage and processing
arrangements, ash handling system, water treatment plant, cooling water system and cooling tower,
De-Mineralized (DM) water plant, compressed air system and balance of plant including high
pressure piping etc. for its successful operation. The provision of extraction cum condensing
machine allows the possibility of operating the plant during the off-season with the saved bagasse
and procured surplus biomass residues.


The Bioethanol Unit:
The purpose of bioethanol plant is to produce ethanol for blending with regular fuel as substitute.
Bioethanol fuel is mainly produced by the sugar fermentation process, although it can also be
manufactured by the chemical process of reacting ethylene with steam. Ethanol can be produced
from biomass by the hydrolysis and sugar fermentation processes. Biomass wastes contain a
complex mixture of carbohydrate polymers from the plant cell walls known as cellulose, hemi
cellulose and lignin. In order to produce sugars from the biomass, the biomass is pre-treated with
acids or enzymes in order to reduce the size of the feedstock and to open up the plant structure.
Thus, bioethanol from sugar plan is the output of series process that goes through Fermentation,
Distillation and Molecular Sieve Dehydration (MSDH) process.

The project activity (i.e. Bioethanol production unit at Koppa) was commissioned in October 2007
and bioethanol is being produced for producing blended biofuel by OMCs to whom NSL has supply
contracts. This blended biofuel is finally used as fuel in existing stationary installations (e.g. diesel
generators) and/or in vehicles within India. The project activity is hence a renewable energy project
activity that displaces more-GHG-intensive fossil fuel for combustion in vehicles and stationary
installations.

The key features of the bioethanol project scope are as follows:
Existing installed capacity : 60 KLPD

Purpose : To supply for biofuel blending by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs)
Blending types : B10 and B20.

The energy values : 44.22 MJ/kg with a blend of 10%(E10)

The targeted blending : Current-12-13%, however, as per central government order to be
achieved 25% blending by year of 2025.

______________

The Scope-1 of this entire project activity (i.e. bagasse based co-generation unit) was registered
with Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of UNFCCC with the Project ID 0865 and initial
verifications were conducted under CDM only till 31 March 2007, followed by an incomplete
submission of monitoring period till 31 March 2010. However, there was no further verification
conducted under CDM or under any other mechanism; whereas UCR registration is being
considered with crediting period only from 01 January 2013. Additionally, the Scope-2 of this
project activity (i.e. bioethanol plant) is not a part of any other GHG mechanism and has never been
applied under any such mechanisms.

However, the plan is operational since the date of its commencement which signifies that the GHG
contributions are continuous. Additionally, NSL keeps different good practices within the project
boundary to achieve all possible sustainability.
